description=This is a sample implementation of how to define the policies of the Zigbee Over-the-air bootload cluster client (a multi-hop, application bootloader).  It allows the implementor to decide what manufacturer ID, image type ID, and file version informatoin is used for when querying the server.  It also defines a couple callbacks that are fired, such as download complete and ready to bootload.

hardwareVersion1.name=Hardware Version 1
hardwareVersion1.description=Devices may have a hardware version that limits what images they can use.  OTA Images may be configured with minimum and maximum hardware versions that they are supported on.  If the device is not restricted by hardware version then this value should be 0xFFFF.

includeHardwareVersion.name=Include Hardware Version
includeHardwareVersion.description=This indicates that the current hardware version of the product should be included in the messages sent to the ZigBee OTA Cluster server.
includeHardwareVersion.type=BOOLEAN
includeHardwareVersion.default=FALSE

eblVerification.name=Perform EBL Verification (SOC Only)
eblVerification.description=This uses the application bootloader routines to verify the EBL image after signature verification passes.
eblVerification.type=BOOLEAN
eblVerification.default=TRUE

deleteFailedDownloads.name=Delete Failed Downloads
deleteFailedDownloads.description=This causes the device to delete any image (partial or complete) that has been downloaded but did not pass verification or when the server tells us to abort the download or upgrade.

deleteFailedDownloads.default=TRUE

maxOtaImageTypes.name
maxOtaImageTypes.name=Maximum number of OTA image types
maxOtaImageTypes.description=The maximum number of ota image types that the client needs to manage.
